\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{mathtools}

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2018} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2018} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}
\newcommand\todo[1]{\textcolor{red}{#1}}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
%\usepackage{icml2018_ift6269}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2018_ift6269}
% SLJ: -> use this for your IFT 6269 project report!

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{Autoregressive VAE for Causal Modeling}

    % It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
    % submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
    % unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2018
    % package.

    % List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
    % identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
    % Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
    % Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

    % You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
    % Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
    % in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This command actually creates the footnote in the first column
% listing the affiliations and the copyright notice.
% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
% The \icmlEqualContribution command is standard text for equal contribution.
% Remove it (just {}) if you do not need this facility.

\printAffiliationsAndNotice{} % otherwise use the standard text.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018. It was modified from a version from Dan Roy in
% 2017, which was based on a version from Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
